Conceal your blemishes. Oily skin is prone to breakouts and blemishes. Applying light layers of liquid matte concealer will help to minimize these imperfections without causing new breakouts. Use the wand or a concealer brush to cover your dark circles, red marks, and imperfections.
For additional coverage, apply a layer of liquid concealer, followed by a layer of powder foundation and another layer of liquid concealer. Seal in the makeup with a final coat of powder foundation. The more layers you apply, the more likely you are to see shiny spots throughout the day. This application method may require several touch ups.
Avoid cream concealers—they will clog your pores.</string>
    <string name="sample_skintips1">Long-lasting powder foundations create an even complexion while combatting excess oil. Before you purchase foundation, read the label carefully—make sure the product is oil-free, mattifying, and noncomedogenic (will not clog your pores). Apply a thin, even layer of powder with a large powder brush. Move the brush in a circular and dabbing motion.
If you need additional coverage, apply a second layer of powder with a clean, damp sponge. Move the sponge in a circular and dabbing motion.[9]
If you do not like powder foundation, select a mousse foundation or a water-based liquid foundation.</string>
